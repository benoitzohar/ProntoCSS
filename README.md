ProntoCSS
=========

ProntoCSS is a simple css framework written in SCSS that contains a simple grid, components and helps (a lot) to prepare printing.

Since the grid is flex based, you can only use ProntoCSS if you target modern browsers.

### Installation

```
yarn add prontocss
```

or

```
bower install prontocss
```

You can use the minified file in dist but we very much suggest that you import `pronto.scss` and override variables.

### Demo documentation and framework details
